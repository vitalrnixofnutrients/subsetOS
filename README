subsetOS is a Operating System whose goal is to provide a Ring 0 Compiler with
inline assembly support that can be used with a serial port on UEFI x86_64 in
357 bytes or fewer. Every time one presses Enter, a single semicolon ending
line of code gets incrementally recompiled. Whatever program was typed in can
be run by typing "run" and pressing Enter. Currently, BOOTX64.EFI exceeds that,
but a PE32+ file header can be as small as 92 bytes and can be statically
linked with the subsetOS object file to produce a 357 byte or fewer PE32+ UEFI
Application. I'm not up for this task, but contributions are welcome, as long
as they're also Public Domain.
